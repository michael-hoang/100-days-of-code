# 50-auto-extend-pythonanywhere-expiry
100 Days of Code

The intended project for Day 50 was to develop an automated bot that swipes profiles on Tinder. However, as I preferred not to disclose my personal information by signing up on Tinder, I came across a suggestion in the course discussion forum. The suggestion was about creating a program that extends the expiration date of a Pythonanywhere running script. Hence, I chose to work on that instead. This decision turned out to be quite convenient for me, as I already had a script for receiving rain SMS notifications on Pythonanywhere.
